ARRAYS

Arrays are used to store multiple items at one place.
These items are of same data type.
The elements in an array are stored in contagious memory location.

Arrays are index based. the first element is stored at a 0th index and 2nd element is stored at 1st index so on.

Array is an object.

Array is accessed using index.

 arr[] = {10,20,30,40,50}
 index =  0, 1, 2, 3, 4

 elements in an array are stored in following order
 x, x+y, x+2y, x+3y, x+4y

 x = Address where array is stored
 y = size of an array element

 Advantages of Array:
 	1. Random Access: We can get any data located at any index position.

 	2. Code Optimization: It means code optimize, we can retrieve or sort data efficiently.

 	3. Cache Friendliness: Cache is a memory closet to the CPU. It is fastest of all memories.

 Disadvantage or Array:

 	We can store only fixed size of elements in an array. Array does not grow at runtime.


 * Types of Arrays:

 	1. Fixed size arrays
 	2. Dynamic arrays: ArrayList

 * Array Declaration:

  	int [] a; //recommended to use
  	int a [];

  	We cannot declare the size of an array at the time of declaration otherwise it will give compile time error.


 * Array Construction:
 	Every array in java is an object we can create by using new operator.

 	int [] a = new int[3];

 * Every array in java is created in heap memory.

 At the time of array construction we should specify the size of array otherwise we might get compile time error.


 If we ae taking array size with -ve int value then we will get runtime exception saying NegativeArraySizeException.


 * Array Initialization:

 	Whenever we are creating an array every element is initialized with default value automatically.

 	int [] a = new int [3];
 	sopln(a); [I@3e12a5s5
